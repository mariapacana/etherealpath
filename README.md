== README

Text-message-based scavenger hunt using Rails and the Twilio API. Admin will be able to design "missions" consisting of clues that are sent to the hunt's participants. They will also be able to track the participants' progress and see how many people have completed each challenge.

Currently a work in progress, but I am hoping to have an MVP up in early January.
